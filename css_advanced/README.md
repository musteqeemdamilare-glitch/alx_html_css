# CSS Advanced

This project is a continuation of the **HTML Advanced project**.  
Here, we focus on applying CSS styles to match a provided design in Figma.  

## Resources
- **Figma design:** [View on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/XXXX/ALX-CSS-Advanced)  
- **Images download:** [Assets link](https://example.com/download/images)  
- **Fonts used:** 
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)  
  - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fonts.com/font/esselte/itc-spin-cycle)  

## Notes
- If fonts are not installed locally, download and install them before opening the project.  
- Some values from Figma are in float (e.g. `12.6px`) â€” rounded values were used in CSS.  
- This project builds on the HTML structure from **HTML Advanced**.
